DocBot : Moksh, a pin-like sensation on the left side of your chest can be a cause for concern. I want to ask you a few more questions to help determine what might be going on. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the chest pain, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or nausea? Have you recently engaged in any strenuous physical activity or exertion that might have triggered the pain? Also, do you have any pre-existing medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, or asthma, that could be contributing to the pain?
