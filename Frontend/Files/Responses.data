DocBot : Moksh, it sounds like you're experiencing a bit of a respiratory challenge. With the persistent cough, fever, and now congestion in your nose, it's possible that you may be dealing with a viral upper respiratory infection, such as a cold or sinus infection. The congestion in your nose could be due to inflammation and excess mucus production, which is often seen in these types of infections. I'd like to know a bit more about your symptoms, so can you tell me: are you experiencing any difficulty breathing, or feeling like you're short of breath, even when you're just sitting still? And have you noticed any discharge or color to the mucus that's coming out of your nose, such as yellow or green? Also, are your symptoms worse at any particular time of day, or after certain activities?
